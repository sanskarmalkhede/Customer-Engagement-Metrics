## 📊 Research & Insights

### **Engagement Score Formula**

Engagement is calculated based on:

- **Login Frequency** (40%)
- **Time Spent on Platform** (30%)
- **Feature Usage** (30%)

**Formula:**

```
Engagement Score = (Login Frequency × 0.4) + (Time Spent × 0.3) + (Feature Usage × 0.3)
```

### **Churn Prediction Model**

- **Inactive for 30+ days → High Churn Risk**
- **Low Engagement Score (<30) → At Risk**
- **Low Retention Category → Likely to churn**

**Basic Formula:**

```
Churn Probability = (Inactive Days × 0.5) + (Low Engagement × 0.5)
```

## 📌 Challenges Faced & Future Improvements

### **Challenges:**

- JSON file storage limits scalability 📂
- Churn prediction is rule-based, not ML-driven 🤖

### **Potential Improvements:**

✅ **Switch JSON to MongoDB** – Handle larger datasets efficiently 📊 ✅ **Implement ML-based Churn Prediction** – Improve accuracy 🤖 ✅ **Add Real-Time Analytics** – Track live user activity 🔥 ✅ **Improve UI Animations** – Enhance loading states 🎨

---

## 🏆 Evaluation & Final Thoughts

✅ **Meets all assignment requirements** – Engagement tracking, AI insights, filtering, visualization ✅ **User-friendly & responsive** – Minimal UI, smooth experience ✅ **Scalable with future improvements** – ML models & database integration possible

🚀 **This project is ready for submission!** If further refinements are needed, MongoDB & ML churn prediction can be added.
